# **AI Virtual Mouse**

Transform the way you interact with your computer with the **AI Virtual Mouse**! This innovative project replaces traditional mouse hardware by enabling hand-gesture-based control. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV and Mediapipe, it delivers a seamless and hands-free user experience for moving the cursor, clicking, and performing other essential mouse actions.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Captures hand movements and gestures using a webcam.
- **Cursor Control**: Moves the mouse pointer based on your hand's position.
- **One-Touch Clicking**: Click actions are triggered through gestures.
- **Smooth Gesture Recognition**: Gesture detection is fast, responsive, and highly accurate.
- **Lightweight and Accessible**: Works on any device with a camera and Python installed.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Hand Detection**: Utilizes Mediapipe's Hand Tracking model to identify 21 hand landmarks.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Analyzes hand poses (like raised fingers or pinching gestures) to detect user intent.
3. **Action Execution**: Translates gestures into mouse actions like movement, clicks, or scrolling.
4. **Screen Mapping**: Ensures smooth and precise cursor movements by mapping hand positions to the screen's resolution.

---

## **Key Gestures**
- **Pointer Movement**: Control the cursor by moving your index finger.
- **Single Click**: Bring the index and thumb fingertips together briefly.
- **Drag and Drop**: Pinch and hold your fingers while moving your hand.
- **Scroll Up/Down**: Gesture with your hand vertically.

## **Why This Project?**
This project represents the future of human-computer interaction by:
- Providing a contactless solution for device navigation.
- - Showcasing the practical use of computer vision in daily life.
- Delivering an educational platform to explore Python and its advanced libraries.

---

## **Built With**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video capture and processing.
- **Mediapipe**: Hand-tracking library to detect and analyze hand gestures.
- **PyAutoGUI**: Executes mouse actions based on detected gestures.

---

## **Core Workflow**
1. **Input**: Video feed from your webcam.
2. **Processing**: Real-time hand detection and gesture recognition.
3. **Output**: Cursor and mouse actions controlled dynamically by your hand.

---

## **Features to Explore Next**
- **Expand Gesture Library**: Add new gestures for right-click, double-click, or custom actions.
- **Enhance Multi-Hand Support**: Implement gestures for dual-hand controls.
- **UI Improvements**: Visual feedback for detected gestures on-screen.
